<h3>This is a project to learn Tailwindcss and get a better understanding of vanilla javascript.</h3>
<p>In this project, I wanted to learn the following javascript topics :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fetch API</li>
  <li>Basic DOM manipulation</li>
  <li>Making a mobile navigation</li>
  <li>Working with JSON files</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Some questions I asked myself about Javascript:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>When I receive product data from the product.json file, how do I display them correctly?</li>
  <li>How does asynchronous Javascript work? And is the fetch API using an asynchronous approach?</li>
  <li>When I receive product data from the product.json file, how do I display them correctly?</li>
  <li>Now that I received all the product data and am able to display them with DOM manipulation, How do I filter this properly by category?</li>
  <li>How do I put all the products data (dynamically) inside cards with Javascript?</li>
  <li>How do I use javascript template strings for writing HTML in my Javascript</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Some questions I asked myself about CSS and Tailwindcss:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>How do I create my own color pallete in Tailwindcss?<li>
  <li>Now that flexbox is something that I can use well, how do I use CSS grid?</li>
  <li>How do I make websites responsive with Tailwindcss?</li>
  <li>Tailwindcss works mobile first, how do I approach this when writing media queries?</li>
  <li>How do I make images responsive for all devices?</li>
  <li>How do transitions work? How can I use this to make the website feel more smooth?</li>
</ul>

<h3>My next goals are :</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Learning a Javascript framework like React or Vue</li>
  <li>Get more experience writing css with Tailwindcss</li>
  <li>Learn a server side rendering framework like Nextjs or Nuxt</li>
  <li>Learn Typescript</li>
</ul>
